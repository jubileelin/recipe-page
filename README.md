### What I learned

I implemented mobile-first workflow in this project, which turned out to be pretty effective. It was not difficult to expand the contents to fit a wider screen.

### Continued development

I want to perfect mobile-first workflow, such as the usage of media querys as effectively as possible, since I felt like some of the media querys I used were kind of janky.
